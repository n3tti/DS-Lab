# Swiss Government Cloud

 With the Swiss Government Cloud (SGC) project, a new cloud infrastructure tailored to the requirements and needs of the Confederation is to be set up at the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication (FOITT). The project will be carried out from 2025 to 2032.

## Brief summary

 Between 2025 and 2032, a new hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure tailored to the requirements and needs of the Confederation is to be set up at the FOITT as part of the Swiss Government Cloud (SGC) project. It will consist of three components: public cloud, public cloud on prem. and private cloud on prem. A guarantee credit of CHF 246.9 million has been requested for this purpose. In total, the project is expected to cost CHF 319.4 million. The SGC is designed to meet the requirements and needs of the federal authorities. However, cantons, cities and communes shall also be able to benefit from the service if they are interested. By contrast, no services will be provided for the private sector via the SGC.

## Background

 Digitalisation is increasing the demand for innovative IT solutions and calls for IT infrastructures that meet higher performance, reliability and security requirements. In order to respond to this development, the federal government intends to focus more on cloud solutions. To create the basis needed for this, the Federal Council adopted the Federal Administration's cloud strategy on 11 December 2020. This envisages a hybrid multi-cloud approach, which means that federal authorities should be able to obtain both internal federal cloud services and cloud services supplied by several external providers, and also combine them.

 The federal government took a first step towards implementing the cloud strategy in 2022 with the ‹Public Clouds Bund› procurement procedure, which supplemented the Federal Administration's existing private cloud offering with public cloud offerings from external providers. The SGC is the next stage in the implementation of the cloud strategy.

## Project content

 With the SGC, it is planned to set up a new hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure tailored to the requirements and needs of the Confederation. Combining both public and private cloud offerings, it is to provide the Federal Administration with a uniform global solution for most of its cloud activities. It will also replace the FOITT's existing cloud offerings.

 To ensure that the SGC can be developed and used in a targeted manner, a holistic approach is being pursued. Overall, investments in five key areas are planned:

### Establishment of a hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure

 At the heart of the project lies the creation of a hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure, consisting of three components:

#### Public cloud

 The first component includes the public cloud services that the FOITT offers its customers via established public cloud providers. The public cloud is characterised in particular by its high degree of scalability and its broad portfolio of innovative services. It is thus a decisive building block for overcoming the federal government's digitalisation challenges. Cloud providers must be able to offer public cloud services that meet additional requirements, e.g. data storage in Switzerland or technical restrictions.

#### Public cloud on prem.

 Within the framework of the second component, public cloud on prem., the solutions of established public cloud providers are operated in federal data centres. In this way, service users can also enjoy the benefits of public cloud services locally (on premises) and process data as directly as possible where it is generated (so-called edge computing). However, the public cloud on prem. will be established only if there is a proven need, and capacity will be increased only at the explicit request of a customer.

#### Private cloud on prem.

 The third component of the SGC is the FOITT's private cloud. Unlike with the public cloud, the entire cloud infrastructure is operated in the federal data centre network. Data is stored and processed exclusively on the Federal Administration's own systems. It should be possible for the private cloud on prem. to be operated solely by the Federal Administration if necessary.

### Expansion of the network infrastructure

 The network infrastructure is crucial to the success of the digital transformation, as it forms the basis for all the services provided by the FOITT's current and future hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure. With the increased use of cloud services in the hybrid cloud model, the requirements for a modern network infrastructure are also changing, e.g. in terms of bandwidth availability, automation and security. For this reason, it is planned to expand the network infrastructure accordingly as part of the project.

### Expansion of cybersecurity

 The aim of cybersecurity is to prevent the misuse and disruption of the IT resources used to perform statutory tasks. However, the challenges in this regard have changed radically: while IT systems used to be operated centrally in data centres and workstations were located in federal buildings, today's technology enables employees to work anywhere and to access the federal network using various devices, a process in which the use of the public cloud is also growing in importance. Implementing the hybrid multi-cloud strategy therefore entails new cybersecurity challenges. In order to meet these challenges, the cybersecurity area for action will ensure that data protection is adapted to the new circumstances.

### Operating and commercial processes

 The growing momentum in the digitalisation environment requires industrialised and highly automated solutions for the technical operation of the hybrid multi-cloud environment (operating processes) and for order processing (commercial processes). Consequently, the entire process chain will be automated within the framework of the operating and commercial processes area for action.

### Training, consulting and governance

 Administrative units must be able to use the SGC in a secure, efficient and targeted manner. The training, consulting and governance area for action will ensure that comprehensive support is available for the use of the hybrid multi-cloud environment if needed. To this end, training and advisory services will be developed and SGC-wide cloud governance established.

## Benefits

 When using cloud services, it is always necessary to weigh up various requirements in the areas of data protection, information security, digital sovereignty, functionality and cost efficiency. With its three-part solution, the SGC can cover the various requirements and needs of the administrative units to the extent necessary. SGC-wide governance will ensure that solutions operated in the SGC can be integrated into the federal system landscape as easily as possible, thereby reducing costs and allowing valuable resources to be invested in the digitalisation of business processes.

 Furthermore, by providing access to innovation, the SGC will enable the Confederation to reap the benefits of digitalisation. Its digital resilience will also be strengthened, as customers will be able to respond quickly to new developments in the business environment thanks to appropriate cloud-based solutions. Regular investment will help ensure that the SGC also meets the Confederation's digitalisation needs in the long term. Data protection and information security are key core requirements for the future IT infrastructure and are therefore given priority. Overall, the SGC will establish an appropriate technical basis for efficiently implementing the main upcoming digitalisation projects of the federal government, and thus make an essential contribution to its digital transformation.

 Cantons, cities and communes shall also be able to benefit from the service if they are interested. By contrast, no services will be provided for the private sector via the SGC.

## Timeframe

 The project will be carried out from 2025 to 2032. The first functionalities of the individual measures should be available as early as 2026. From 2027, the volume of functionalities that can be used productively must be sufficient to start migrating specialist applications from the FOITT's existing cloud infrastructures. The migration is expected to be completed by the end of 2030. Optimisation and further development work will be carried out on the SGC during the migration and through to the end of the project in 2032, so as to ensure that the solution remains fit for purpose and innovative.

## Financial implications

 A guarantee credit of CHF 246.9 million has been requested. In total, the project is expected to cost CHF 319.4 million, which also includes the FOITT's own work and investments over the entire duration of the programme, as well as expenditure that will be incurred already in 2024 for preparatory work.

 No additional internal resources are planned for the SGC.

## Index

## The SGC in the context of the Federal Administration's cloud strategy

 The SGC is based directly on the Federal Administration's cloud strategy adopted by the Federal Council on 11 December 2020. It is the result of the implementation of this strategy at the FOITT. It constitutes a global solution for most of the Federal Administration's cloud activities and in the future will cover its cloud levels I and IIa (public cloud component of the SGC), IIb (public cloud on prem. component of the SGC) and III (private cloud on prem. component of the SGC).
